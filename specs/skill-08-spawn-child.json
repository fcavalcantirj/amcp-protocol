    "  1. Parent deploys new VM (openclaw-deploy or manual)",
    "  2. On child VM: amcp identity create → new AID + keypairs",
    "  3. Child's identity.json stored locally (never shared)",
    "  4. Parent records child's AID (for monitoring, not access)",
    "  5. Child creates first checkpoint: previousCID=null, parentAID=parent.aid",
    "  6. Child registers on Solvr with their own account",
    "",
    "MEMORY ISOLATION GUARANTEES:",
    "  - Parent CANNOT read child's checkpoints (different AID + private key)",
    "  - Child CANNOT read parent's checkpoints (same)",
    "  - No shared keys, no shared encryption, no shared memories",
    "  - parentAID is metadata for lineage tracking only",

    "WHAT PARENT CAN DO:",
    "  ✅ Monitor child (Telegram, healthcheck)",
    "  ✅ Know child's AID (public info)",
    "  ✅ Verify child's checkpoint signatures (public key derivable from AID)",
    "  ✅ Trigger resurrection (but uses CHILD'S identity.json on child's VM)",

    "WHAT PARENT CANNOT DO:",
    "  ❌ Read child's memory contents",
